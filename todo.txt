# Primary
Check consistency of current moves
Think about appropriate random picking strategy
Implement simulation
Implement observables
Implement dynamic vertex neighbour lookup. May need to alter Vertex data structure

## Secondary 
Figure out appropriate width of initial strip configuration
Reconsider whether current add move implementation chooses an insertion site uniformly
