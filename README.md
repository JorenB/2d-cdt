# Monte Carlo Simulation of Two-Dimensional Causal Dynamical Triangulations

This codebase provides a simple framework for sampling the partition sum of two-dimensional Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT), primarily as a model of two-dimensional lattice quantum gravity. It is straightforward to implement custom observables for which one can subsequently compute ensemble averages, corresponding to its quantum expectation value. Simulation parameters can be set using a config file.
